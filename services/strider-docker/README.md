# Running Apache Spark Standalone Cluster on Docker

Have to admit that it's not easy to deploy a spark standalone cluster totally successfully on docker, because of so many parametres to which we have to pay attention. Here, I will show you how to create a docker compose file for spark cluster manually and then how to run it and test it with a spark streaming application.

I have made a simple example of a spark cluster with 4 nodes. One is for zookeeper, one is for kafka, one is for spark master and the last one is for spark worker. The number of spark worker is scalable. We just need to add some spark workers as services in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

I will begin from the dockerfiles in different components, then [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and then the test of the cluster by deploying an application.

## Dockerfile for zookeeper

Since there is zookeeper in kafka_2.11-0.8.2.2.tgz, we will use the inside zookeeper to ensure the compatibility with kafka. Here is the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/zookeeper/Dockerfile). We just need to implement a java environment to before 

## Dockerfile for kafka

In this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/kafka/Dockerfile), We will use the same kafka package kafka_2.11-0.8.2.2.tgz and we will write the same docker code as the docker file for zookeeper except that we will add several commands to start kafka (Actually we need to start zookeeper firstly, so we'll add the start command for zookeeper in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)).

## Dockerfile for spark master

Since our object is to run a spark streaming applicaion which is a sbt project on a spark cluster, we need to install the environments of java, scala, sbt, spark and spark streaming for a cluster node in this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/spark-master/Dockerfile). Due to the problem our user interface written in python, we have to add spark applications and data to the master node via this file.

## Dockerfile for spark worker

We have the same [Dockerfile](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/spark-worker/Dockerfile) as spark master except that we don't add spark applications and data to the node.

## Docker Compose

This is a vital part, because the cluster might not work if we don't configure some very important parametres.

With this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), we want to make a four-node spark standalone cluster of which one is for zookeeper, one is for kafka, one is for spark master and one is for spark worker. So we have created 4 servces in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

As you can see, we have defined an order for constructing this cluster step by step by using the key word <b>links</b>. Firstly, we need to build the image of the linked services. In [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), <b>spark master</b> linked by <b>spark worker</b> links <b>kafka</b>; <b>spark worker</b> links <b>spark master</b> and <b>kafka</b>; <b>kafka</b> links <b>zookeeper</b>. Therefore, the order to build the images of different components of this cluster is : <br/>1). zookeeper  <br/>2). kafka  <br/>3). spark master  <br/>4). spark worker

### zookeeper

To build an image for zookeeper, we need to specify the path of zookeeper's Dockerfile. Defining a hostname for a service will facilitate the access to it. Then we specify the default port <b>2181</b> for zookeeper and add a command :

```bash -c "kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh kafka/config/zookeeper.properties  && sleep 5s"```

which will start the zookeeper service when the zookeeper container is running.

### kafka

For kafka, we add <b>links</b> to indicate that to run a kafka, it's necessary to run a zookeeper firstly. The default port of kafka is <b>9092</b>. Since we are in a cluster mode and we only have one kafka broker in our cluster, we will define <b>KAFKA_BROKER_ID</b> as 0. the <b>KAFKA_HOST_NAME</b> is the ip of this container. Since the kafka container will take the second place and the first container will use 172.17.0.2, the ip of kafka is certainly <b>172.17.0.3</b>. It's not necessary to specify <b>KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT</b>. We connect kafka and zookeeper by defining <b>KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT</b> with <b>172.17.0.2:2181</b>

### spark master

The command:

```spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master -h spark-master```

declares that this service will be used as spark master. And ```spark://spark-master:7077``` defines the host address of the master.

By default, port 7077 is for master and we need to submit our application to this port; the port for your application's dashboard is 4040; 8042 is the port for management web UI of Hadoop node; 8080 is the port for master web UI and 8088 is the port for Hadoop cluster web UI.

### spark worker

```spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://spark-master:7077```

declares this service as spark worker of the spark master spark://spark-master:7077. 8081 is the web UI port of this worker.

## Run the cluster 

Go into this project where you can find [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LI-Ke/standalone-spark-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). 

Run:

```docker-compose up -d```

You will see the results as follows

![start docker compose](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/tmp/start%20containers.png)

which means that the 4 containers have been created and are running.

## Test the cluster

At this moment, zookeeper and kafka have been started. What we need to do is to create a topic:

```
docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q kafka) kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper 172.17.0.2:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic S-1i
```

In our example, the topic is "S-1i".

```
Copy our applications and data ito the spark worker container (if you don't need an user interface, 
do the following commands. But before, spark master and spark worker should share the same Dockerfile 
without adding data and applications)


docker cp kafkaConsumer.jar cluster_spark-worker_1:/usr/local/kafkaConsumer.jar
docker cp kafkaProducer.jar cluster_spark-worker_1:/usr/local/kafkaProducer.jar
docker cp lubm.nt cluster_spark-worker_1:/usr/local/lubm.nt
```


Submit a kafka consumer application to the cluster. The application will count the number of RDF triples received every second and it takes the broker address, the topic and the number of partitions as parametres.

```
docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q spark-master) spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 --class sparkStreaming.Receiver kafkaConsumer.jar 172.17.0.3:9092 S-1i 1
```


Launch the kafka producer application to send RDF triples to kafka. It takes the data file path, the broker address, the topic and the number of partitions as parametres.

```
docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q spark-master) java -jar kafkaProducer.jar lubm.nt 172.17.0.3:9092 S-1i 1
```

The output result in the comsumer terminal is :

![results of consumer](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/tmp/results%20of%20consumer.png)

#### Let's look at the web UI of this spark standalone cluster. 

This is the web UI of the master node:

![master web UI](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/tmp/master%20web%20ui.png)

In this page we can see that there is a worker in this cluster and there is also a running application which is the kafka consumer.

Here is the worker web UI:

![worker web UI](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/tmp/worker%20web%20ui.png)

And here is the application web UI:


![application web UI](https://github.com/LI-Ke/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker/blob/master/tmp/application%20web%20ui.png)

To stop our running containers, there are two ways:
```
docker-compose stop
```
will just stop running containers, and
```
docker-compose down
```
will stop running containers and then delete them.
